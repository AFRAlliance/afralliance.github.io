# Organisation Metadata

Well what is Organisation Metadata? These are numbers, dropdowns or checkboxes that you can add to Organisations to record data that the base platform doesn't allow you to track otherwise.

A few examples of ways this is used:

* Which district is this organisation from?
* What year did we start receiving food from this supermarket?
* This organisation is a part of a bigger group of organisations (e.g. A branch of a chain)

## Types of Organisation Metadata

* Yes/No - This is a checkbox which you can set as Yes or No

* Single-Select - This is a list of options; each organisation can have one (or none) of the options selected.

* Number - This is a positive number that can represent any quantity or other number.
