# Creating Custom Units

ðŸ¥­ Some members have historically used alternative units, most commonly:

* Banana Boxes, often estimated at 10â€“15 kg per box
* Other containers or local measures specific to their workflows

The AFRA Data Platform supports these units by allowing each one to be configured with a specific kilogram equivalent. For example:


| Unit          | Multiplier (kg)     |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Banana Box    | 13 kg               |
| Crate         | 10 kg               |
| Custom Unit   | Set by org admin    |
