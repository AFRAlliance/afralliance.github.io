# How to Sign Up

Getting started is simple and broken into three key steps:


## 🧑‍💻 1. Logging In

1. Visit 👉 [data.afra.org.nz](data.afra.org.nz)

2. Click “Sign in with Email” or “Sign in with Google”


- *Sign in with Email:*
You’ll receive a magic link via email — click it to log in.

This uses the standard Google sign-in (OAuth) process.


> 📧 Check your spam/junk folder if you don’t receive the magic link within a minute or two.



## 🏢 2. Connect to Your Organisation’s Space
