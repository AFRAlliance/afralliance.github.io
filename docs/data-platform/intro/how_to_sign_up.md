# How to Sign Up

Getting started is simple and broken into three key steps:


## 🧑‍💻 1. Logging In

1. Visit 👉 [data.afra.org.nz](https://data.afra.org.nz)

2. Click “Sign in with Email” or “Sign in with Google”


- *Sign in with Email:*
You’ll receive a magic link via email — click it to log in.


- *Sign in with Google:*
This uses the standard Google sign-in (OAuth) process.


> 📧 Check your spam/junk folder if you don’t receive the magic link within a minute or two.



## 🏢 2. Connect to Your Organisation’s Space

If your organisation is already using the platform:

> 🔗 Talk to your organisation’s AFRA admin to be added to your team’s space.


If your organisation is not yet on the platform:

> 📩 [Reach out to the AFRA Data Lead to get started.](mailto:quinn@afra.org.nz)


## 📥 3. Import Existing Data (If applicable)
