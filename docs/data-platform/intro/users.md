# Users, what do I need to know?!

First off, what does a **user role** mean?

You have access to a simpler platform experience, you only have access to the things you need.

1. You can enter data with the transaction form.

2. You can view transactions from the last 7 days.

## How do I know I'm a user?

## Getting help.

To view information on the Transaction Form, and how that works.. Check out, ['Entering transactions'](/data-platform/transactions/entering_transactions)
