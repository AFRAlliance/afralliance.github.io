## What Are Units?

Units are a multiplier applied to the quantity of each food item in a transaction. They standardize how food volumes are recorded, making data meaningful and comparable across different organisations.

### AFRA’s Recommended Practice

📏 Weigh all food items
AFRA strongly recommends that members weigh every item coming in and going out, and record the weight in kilograms (kg). This provides the most accurate and consistent data for reporting and analysis.



### Custom Units: Banana Boxes & Others

🥭 Some members have historically used alternative units, most commonly:

* Banana Boxes, often estimated at 10–15 kg per box
* Other containers or local measures specific to their workflows

The AFRA Data Platform supports these units by allowing each one to be configured with a specific kilogram equivalent.
